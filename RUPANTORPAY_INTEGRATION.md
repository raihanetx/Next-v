# RupantorPay Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview
Your e-commerce website now supports instant payments through RupantorPay, alongside the existing manual payment options.

## ✅ What's Been Integrated

### 1. Dual Payment System
- **RupantorPay**: Instant payment processing (bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Bank Cards, etc.)
- **Manual Payment**: Traditional methods requiring admin verification

### 2. Payment Flow
```
Customer Selects Products → Goes to Checkout → Chooses Payment Method:
├── RupantorPay (Instant)
│   └── Redirect to Payment Gateway → Auto Order Creation
└── Manual Payment (Traditional)
    └── Submit Payment Info → Admin Verification → Order Confirmation
```

### 3. API Endpoints Created
- `/api/rupantorpay/create-payment` - Creates payment requests
- `/api/rupantorpay/webhook` - Handles payment confirmations
- `/api/rupantorpay/verify-payment` - Verifies payment status

### 4. New Pages
- `/payment/success` - Payment confirmation page
- `/payment/cancel` - Payment cancellation page

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
